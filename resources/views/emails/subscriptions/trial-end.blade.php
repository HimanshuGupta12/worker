    Once you add your credit card details and create a subscription, we will automatically charge you every month. The system will calculate how many active workers you have had last month and you will be charged according to the module you have selected and the maximum number of workers you had that month. The invoice will be sent to this email address and it can also be found under the billing section inside your worker account.
